# Application Credentials Sync

This module is a starting framework to allow the synchronisation of APIC application credentials to an external server.

This module will only synchronise the credentials of applications created by consumers in the developer portal site UI. It cannot sychronise the credentials for applications created by the provider in the API Manager UI.

Further documentation on this scenario and how to use this module can be found in the IBM API Connect Knowledge Center: 


### Note: This module requires APIC v10, it will not work in APIC v5.

This module is provided as-is as a sample.
