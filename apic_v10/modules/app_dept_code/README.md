# Custom field on applications

This module adds a custom field (a department code) to the application node type, showing how to use Drupal hooks to add a validator to application creation forms to validate a custom field.  In this case it is validating that 'field_dept_code' is of the form 'DEPnnn'.
There are 2 application creation forms, normal and modal, this module adds it to both.

Further documentation on this scenario and how to use this module can be found in the IBM API Connect Knowledge Center:
