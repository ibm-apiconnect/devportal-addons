# Deprecated Notification

This module is triggered when a Product is deprecated.

It uses drupal hooks to get triggered, and could then do whatever you want, in this case it uses some code from the mail subscribers wizard module to send an email to the consumer organization owners that are subscribed to a plan from that product.
