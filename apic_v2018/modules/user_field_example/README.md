# Custom user field validation example

This module shows how to use Drupal hooks to add a validator to user register page to validate a custom field.
In this case it is validating that 'field_department_code' is of the form 'DEPnnn'.
If that custom field was also shown on the edit profile page then you would also want to add the same validator to that form ID too.

Further documentation on this scenario and how to use this module can be found in the IBM API Connect Knowledge Center:
