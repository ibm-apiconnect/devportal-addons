APIConnect Explorer needs downloading and placing in this directory.

Ensure you use the v4 version of Explorer from npmjs

npm pack apiconnect-explorer@4.x

The content of the 'package/dist' folder from the expanded apiconnect-explorer.tgz needs copying here
so that there is then a folder structure like explorer/app/assets/...
